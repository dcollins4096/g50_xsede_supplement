We are requesting a supplement of \request\ on \emph{Stampede 2} to our existing ACCESS allocation.
Our allocation supports four projects in astrophysical plasmas. One of which is
a study of the statistics of supersonic turbulence, wherein we develop a number
of interesting analytic models for the correlations between density and
velocity in such flows.  This is a new line of inquiry for us, and our previous
ACCESS request was conservative as we finished the models.  We have now finished
the models, published the first paper on the topic, and performed the proposed
simulations.  It is now time to complete the study.

We recognize that this request is somewhat larger than our initial request, and
that \emph{Stampede 2} is nearing the end of its life.   We are confident that
we can perform the simulations and analyze the results in a matter of weeks from
the approval of this supplement.   We are proposing 12 simulations that will
each take about 9 days on 64 KNL nodes, and several will be run concurrently.
