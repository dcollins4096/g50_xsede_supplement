We are requesting  \request\ SUs  on \emph{Stampede 2} and
\requestdisk\ Gb on Ranch to supplement our existing ACCESS allocation.
Our allocation supports four projects in astrophysical plasmas. One of which is
a study of the statistics of supersonic isothermal turbulence, wherein we have developed a number
of interesting analytic models for the correlations between density and
velocity in such flows.  Our previous
ACCESS request was conservative as we finished the models and performed
preliminary runs.  We have now finished
the models, performed the
preliminary
simulations, and published the first paper on the topic.  It is now time to complete the study.

We recognize that this request is somewhat larger than our initial request, and
that \emph{Stampede 2} is nearing the end of its life.   We are confident that
we can perform the simulations and analyze the results in a matter of weeks from
the approval of this supplement.   We are proposing 12 simulations that will
each take about 9 days on 64 KNL nodes, and they will be run in three batches of
four concurrent simulations.  Thus the simulations will be completed by the end
of March 2023.
