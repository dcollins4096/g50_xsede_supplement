\caption{The accounting for the request. The total cost for each simulation,
$SU=\frac{N_Z N_U N_N}{N_C \zeta}\frac{1}{3600}$.  For the proposed 12
simulations, $N_Z=1024^3$, $N_N=64$, $N_C=4096$, $\zeta=10^5=$(core
updates)/(processor second).  $N_U=T/\Delta t$ is the number of steps, and
depends on \mach\ as described in the text.  $T_{wall}=SU/N_N$ is presented in hours.}
